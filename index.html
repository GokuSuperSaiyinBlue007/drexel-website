            <p>People on the autism spectrum are valuable members of our communities. They have roles to play, dreams to achieve, and contributions to make.</p>
            <p>There is an urgent need for understanding how life unfolds across the lifespan for people on the autism spectrum. Medical and clinical interventions are vital. But we must also learn about the experiences that help or hinder quality of life for people on the autism spectrum, their families, and our communities. Experiences such as transition into adulthood, employment and continued education, living arrangements, and community participation are understudied.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size:0.9em;">Four interconnected initiatives</p>
            <p>Independence and quality of life have many interconnected parts: family well-being, mental and physical health, financial well-being, housing, employment, social participation, college and vocational training. It is difficult to improve just one without paying attention to the others at the same time. We need a holistic approach.</p>
            <p>We will foster holistic widespread and sustainable improvement by building four related initiatives. Each initiative is comprised of multiple subprojects.</p>

                Read more about the first in a series of National Autism Report's here.  The inaugural report is on transition into young adulthood.
                The initiative also is launching the “Measuring What Matters” research project to understand what different stakeholders consider a positive outcome in young adulthood.

        <p class="proj-text">Outcomes for transition age youth on the autism spectrum are poor across multiple domains including work, postsecondary education access, social inclusion, health and mental health. About 50,000 to 60,000 youth on the autism spectrum turn 18 years old each year. It is imperative to understand the needs of these youth so that we may develop and implement appropriate policies and practices to support a positive transition to adulthood. Despite large investments in research and services for children with autism, young adult health and functional outcomes remain poor on average. The Autism Transitions Research Project is a programmatic series of three studies, each salient to specific subsets of the population and particular service systems. This will yield up to date, useful, targeted and impactful findings that can inform services planning, benchmarking and public policy at a population health level. Taken together, our programmatic series of studies will significantly expand the evidence base on factors associated with healthy life outcomes among adolescents and young adults with ASD in order to improve transition care and services for this population. With a desire to maximize generalizability and the return on research investment.</p>
        <p class="proj-text">This research initiative is funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA grant # UJ2MC31073) from September 1, 2017 through  August 31, 2022.</p>
